grid/ The ejecta from binary and single stars as function of initial mass

iso_{binary,single}.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each file contains the initial star mass (solar masses), followed by the eject from each mass loss process (solar masses). 
The _int represent how much (in solar masses) was from the initial composition, thus the yield is x - x_int


winds/ The wind ejecta from binary and single 45Msun star as function of wind eta

iso_{binary,single}.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each file contains the wind eta, followed by the wind ejecta
The _int represent how much (in solar masses) was from the initial composition, thus the yield is x - x_int


ccsn/ The CCSN ejecta from binary and single 17Msun star as a function of the explosion properties

iso_{binary,single}.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each file contains the explosion properties (energy (10**51 erg/s), mass cut (msun), injection time(s), injection mass (msun))                                    
The _int represent how much (in solar masses) was from the initial composition, thus the yield is x - x_int
